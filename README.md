# Entsorgungskalender - Karlsruhe
Fetch the dates for trash pickups for the city of Karlsruhe, Germany

Our beautiful city sadly doesn't have an easy way of getting the pickup dates for the various types of trash. Additionally, the dates are not very easy to remember or very regular.
This python application is intended as a backend for a more complex service, usind `Postgresql` as a database to store users and future dates.

Without a the database, this application is useless for you. If you just need the dates for your street, either use this code as a base for your own crawler or use the telegram bot this was created for.
